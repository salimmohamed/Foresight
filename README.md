# Foresight: Trading Insights

This project began as a humble exercise on Day 36 of the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" course. What started as a simple stock monitoring script quickly evolved into a captivating exploration of financial data, real-time alerts, and the immense potential of artificial intelligence in trading. My fascination with leveraging technology to gain an edge in financial markets has driven me to expand this foundational CLI application.

This repository represents the initial phase of building a sophisticated trading assistant. My vision extends beyond basic alerts; I aim to integrate advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI techniques to analyze market sentiment, predict trends, and ultimately, provide intelligent, actionable insights for trading decisions. The long-term goal is to develop a system capable of not just informing, but potentially automating, trading strategies based on robust AI analysis.

## Learning Journey & Technical Growth

### From CLI to Full-Stack Web Application
This project demonstrates my progression from basic Python scripting to full-stack web development:

- **Phase 1**: Started with command-line Python scripts using `argparse`, `requests`, and `smtplib`
- **Phase 2**: Evolved into a Flask REST API with comprehensive endpoints and data management
- **Phase 3**: Built a modern Next.js frontend with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and component libraries
- **Phase 4**: Integrated real-time data processing, authentication, and advanced UI/UX patterns

### Key Learning Outcomes
- **API Integration**: Mastered external API consumption (Alpha Vantage, NewsAPI) with error handling and rate limiting
- **Full-Stack Development**: Gained proficiency in both frontend (React/Next.js) and backend (Python/Flask) technologies
- **Real-time Systems**: Implemented live data updates, WebSocket connections, and event-driven architectures
- **Database Design**: Designed efficient data models for financial data, user preferences, and alert management
- **Security Best Practices**: Implemented authentication, input validation, and secure API key management
- **DevOps & Deployment**: Deployed both frontend and backend to cloud platforms with CI/CD pipelines
