# Foresight Project Rules

## Project Context
- This is an AI-powered trading insights platform
- Frontend: https://foresight-wealth.vercel.app/ (Next.js)
- API: https://foresight-api-theta.vercel.app/ (Flask)
- Current state: Frontend has demo pages, backend has core functionality
- Goal: Connect frontend to real API endpoints

## Key Information
- API endpoints: /api/health, /api/stocks, /api/dashboard/portfolio, /api/dashboard/alerts
- Core alert processing is in main.py
- Frontend uses mock data in stockService.ts
- Need to replace demos with real functionality

## Development Guidelines
- Don't run build commands (user handles this)
- Focus on connecting frontend to deployed API
- Maintain existing UI/UX patterns
- Use TypeScript for frontend code
